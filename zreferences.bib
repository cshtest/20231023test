	abstract = {The apparent linear (ohmic) characteristics, exhibited by a high-purity, p-type, single-crystal specimen of silicon of uniform resistivity (ca. 2200 Ω-cm at room temperature), having rhodium-plated end contacts, were changed to rectifying characteristics by formation of a reduced-area contact at one end (the reduced area was attained by grinding down the original contact). The rectification characteristics improved with decreasing temperature, provided that the temperature is not too low. Voltage-profile and resistivity measurements were made at various temperatures ranging from 116°C to -196°C. These curves show that the maximum of the injection fraction, (Δn) p0, and of the resistivity both occur at approximately 90°C. The values of these maxima are respectively 5·5 per cent (total current 10 mA, current density at small-area contact 125 mA/cm2) and 2980 Ω-cm. The low-temperature voltage contours indicate that the plated contacts, with both small and large area, become good barriers below -68°C. The asymmetry between the large- and small-area contact is much greater at -196°C than at -68°C. At room temperature, the transient behavior manifests the characteristic logarithmic injection curve. Solder and rhodium-plated contacts and transient-current studies indicate that a small amount of injection occurs also at the large-area contact. © 1961.},

A variety of devices currently in existance permit both subjective viewing and quantitative analysis of images inaccessible to the unaided human eye. In addition to their normal use to provide real time images, for immediate viewing by an observer, both direct view devices and television cameras can be used to obtain time exposures of stationary scenes. In these applications of light flux as low as one photon per picture element per minute can be integrated over an extended period to form a useful image. Starting with the fundamental physical limitations to vision this paper discusses electronic low light imaging in the electromagnetic spectrum from the vacuum ultraviolet to the near infrared. The detection of weak X-ray, gamma-ray, XUV, beta particle, and neutron images with the aid of suitable energy conversion screens is also described.

	abstract = {It is shown that while there is the possibility of a low collection efficiency or 'dead' layer in intimate Schottky solar cells, the presence of a thin insulating layer makes this unlikely in MIS cells. Hence in addition to its well established effect of substantially increasing the open circuit voltage of Schottky cells, the thin insulating layer in MIS cells may also marginally increase the short circuit current by virtue of an improved short-wavelength response. Grain boundaries are shown to be particularly ineffective recombination sites in depletion regions and this leads to a similarly good short-wavelength response for polycrystalline MIS cells. Finally, grating MIS cells are described which display AMI efficiencies based on active area of 10. 5\% and 13. 9\% for 4 cm**2 cells on poly- and single-crystalline silicon respectively.},

The novel MINP solar cell structure is quite similar to the conventional cell structure, having the normal diffused p-n junction, top and rear contacts, and anti-reflection coating. The important difference is that it has a very thin thermal silicon oxide grown along the entire top surface of the silicon substrate. This layer passifies the entire top surface of the cell, giving it near ideal electronic properties. At the same time, the oxide layer is kept very thin, only about 20 angstroms, so that it does not restrict current flow between the top contact and the silicon substrate. With this structure output voltages over 690 millivolts, only marginally short of the target of 700 millivolts, have been obtained. Cells with the energy efficiency in the 16 to 17 percent range have been produced even with the very simple cell design. Efficiencies in the 18 to 19 percent range can be obtained without difficulty.},

The small associated cost is likely to be more than offset by increased module reliability, greater output in the field due to improved shadow tolerance, and simpler module assembly compared to discrete bypass diode approaches.

It is shown that plasma processing can significantly reduce the contact resistance of screen-printed metallization, in addition to previously documented effects. Extra-heavy doping of the emitter combined with etchback gave the best plasma-processed results. A study of this approach in a nonplasma sequence has produced a 15. 8\% efficient polycrystalline silicon cell on Wacker Silso substrates. This is believed to be one of the highest efficiency cells of this size fabricated to date on any solar-grade substrate material.},

The significance of these results does not lie only in the first demonstration of such high current gains in devices of sufficiently high breakdown voltage to be of use in a wide range of applications.

This reduces reflection from the cell surface from 3-4\% without antireflection coatings to below 0.2\%. Tilting of the geometrical features allows very effective light trapping within the cell when combined with a planar rear surface.

An alternative value of 1.08 × 10-10 cm-3 was suggested. A new experimental measurement of 1.01 × 1010 cm-3 is reported with an estimated one standard deviation uncertainty of only 3\%. This appears to be the most accurate experimental determination of this parameter at any temperature. Measurements with similar accuracy at temperatures in the range of 275 to 375 K are also reported.},

The first is the latent efficiency still to be recovered with even the most highly developed cell technologies. The second is the recent progress with tandem cells, which suggests that most of the 30-40\% efficiency advantage over single-junction devices will eventually be realized. Tandem cells are likely to offer cost advantages in very high volume production. The third is the pyramid of possibilities, the wide range of semiconductors which still have to be evaluated for their photovoltaic potential.},

	abstract = {We propose a new generation of metal-silicide Schottky infrared detector arrays. These arrays have high detector fill factors, small pixel sizes, and a short manufacturing sequence which should lead to high processing yields of large detector arrays. Our 'Fully Integrated Schottky Array' (FISA) uses metal silicide gates, which lie directly on silicon, for both infrared detection and charge transfer. The detector array is designed as a frame transfer device. An array of infrared sensitive Schottky CCD gates is connected to an array of non-sensitive Schottky CCD gates for frame storage before reading out line by line through a Schottky gate read-out CCD. The development of the FISA involves new ways of sub-micron patterning of the gaps between the metal Schottky gates using conventional photolithographic techniques. Low Schottky barrier height silicides are used for infrared detection, metal silicides having high Schottky barrier heights are used for the non-infrared-sensitive storage CCDs and the read-out CCDs. Since the Schottky CCDs use no gate oxides, the charge handling capabilities are higher than in conventional CCDs. In addition, the device is more radiation resistant, and has inbuilt anti-blooming features.},

During 1990 and 1991, the first results from commercial pilot production of these cells were reported. These confirm that the efficiency advantage of this technology can be realized in commercial production with efficiency 25-35\% higher than screen-printing sequences demonstrated. Recent laboratory improvements for the buried contact cell which have resulted in cell efficiencies above 21\% are reported. These improvements also appear transferable to commercial production.

By considering the QW to be isolated, in that carrier flow into and out of the QW is prevented, the open circuit voltage of the incremental cell is determined as a function of cell width. This method indicates that a QW reduces the voltage of the baseline cell but the efficiency may still increase, particularly if the baseline cell's band gap is greater than or equal to its optimum value for the illuminating spectrum.},

Our approach is better than previous analyses because of the improved treatment of generation and recombination via impurities, and because it includes the effects of optical competition and light trapping. The approach is applied to indium as the IPV effect impurity incorporated into an idealised silicon solar cell. The analysis is based on experimentally determined parameters for indium. Improvements of cell current, subgap spectral response and energy conversion efficiency are quantified. Our analysis reveals the importance of light trapping and proper selection of indium and dopant concentrations. For the first time, the IPV effect is shown to lead to improved solar cell efficiency.},

Absorption coefficient values as low as 10-7cm-1have been determined, revealing structure due to 3- and 4- phonon assisted absorption. The influences of free carrier absorption, bandgap narrowing, and the Franz-Keldysh effect on cell infrared response are considered. Investigation of the IPV effect of indium in high efficiency bulk and thin film cells reveals that indium improves their infrared response.

	abstract = {The use of static concentrators provides a level of concentration sufficient for significant cost reductions, without any of the problems of high concentration systems. There is no need for expensive tracking, most of the diffuse light is collected and passive cooling can be used for the cells. Following the construction of prototypes that confirm computer ray tracing predictions a structure has been designed for the manufacture of a 1 kW roof top array in association with the state power authority. Two manufacturing techniques for the array and potential commercial production are described. The pilot line at the University of New South Wales has commenced production of bifacial buried contact solar cells for the project. These cells provide the necessary high efficiency and low cost. Measurements have been made on the amount of dust likely to be present on a typical module, the effect on total internal reflection and thus the concentrator performance.},

New BC structures, in particular the double sided (DS) BC cell, allow further improvements in cost and efficiency. Improvements in efficiency arise through improved rear surface passivation. Experimental results from DSBC cells using various passivation methods demonstrate that a floating junction (FJ) passivates as well as passivation schemes used with high efficiency cells. 2D analysis and experimental results both show localized defects have prevented FJ passivation from achieving its potential and that optimization of the rear doping or by bifacial operation can improve performance.},

The structure consists of multiple p- and n-type silicon layers. This paper examines the tolerance of the cell design to a range of metallic impurities and grain boundaries using computer simulations. The modelled results indicate that the device can tolerate impurity concentrations up to 250 times greater than a conventional, thick solar cell. Further, the results indicate that the structure has excellent tolerance to grain boundaries present in bulk regions of the device. The simulations indicate that grain boundaries present in depletion regions will limit efficiencies considerably if the effective recombination velocity of the grain boundary approaches 107 cm/s. This extreme case should be largely avoided utilizing grain boundary passivation techniques during device fabrication.},

This necessitates a supporting substrate of a foreign material, with refractive index compatible with light trapping schemes for the silicon. The resulting inability to nucleate growth of crystalline silicon films of good crystallographic quality on such foreign substrates, at present prevents the achievement of high efficiency devices using conventional single junction solar cell structures. The parallel multijunction solar cell provides a new approach for achieving high efficiencies from very poor quality material, with near unity collection probabilities for all generated carriers achieved through appropriate junction spacing. Heavy doping is used to minimise the dark saturation current contribution from the layers, therefore allowing respectable voltages. The design strategy, corresponding advantages, theoretical predictions and experimental results are presented.},

Each of these will degrade the fill factor if the range of junction biases corresponding to the rear surface transition, coincides with the maximum power point. Despite the identified non idealities, PERL cells with rear floating junctions (PERF cells) have achieved record open circuit voltages for silicon solar cells, while simultaneously achieving fill factor improvements relative to standard PERL solar cells. Without optimisation, a record efficiency of 22\% has been demonstrated for a cell with a rear floating junction. The results of both theoretical and experimental studies are provided.},

Silicon crystals with (111) preferred orientation were obtained using slow cooling rates and for thinner film thicknesses, while (110) oriented films were obtained using higher cooling rates and greater film thicknesses. These materials exhibited few crystal defects apart from twinned crystals which are not generally harmful to solar cell performance, and thus have enormous potential for thin film silicon solar cell applications, especially for the multi-junction thin film silicon solar cell structure developed at the Centre.},

Laser texturing has been investigated with good results. However, mechanical texturing would appear to have economic advantages. A rear junction structure also has advantages for polycrystalline substrates in cases where the diffusion length is only about the half the substrate thickness. Such structures have also been successfully implemented using the laser grooved approach. More recently, the laser grooved, buried contact approach has been adapted for use with thin film silicon layers deposited onto supporting substrates or superstrates.

The analytical model is compared to a complete numerical simulation package (DESSIS) and found to be in good agreement.

In this process, three lengthy high temperature processes are necessary. In recent months, a simplified process has been developed that eliminates these three lengthy high temperature processes associated with groove diffusion, back surface field formation and the growth of a thick thermal oxide on the surface. Although considerable performance loss is sustained when applied to floatzone substrates, the simplified process appears capable of achieving similar efficiencies to the conventional BCSC process when applied to solar grade Czochralski and multicrystalline substrates. Just as importantly, the simplified BCSC process has been developed for implementation onto existing screen printing production lines using virtually all the same equipment except for the addition of the grooving process which is applied to the virgin wafer prior to any other processing. This process appears to be particularly well suited to existing manufacturers of screen printed solar cells, where the higher performance and lower cost of the BCSC can be achieved without the need for the decommissioning of existing equipment or large scale investment in new infrastructure and equipment.},

This shows that, for general solar cell geometries with uniformly doped bulk regions, the probability of collection of a carrier generated at any point in the cell equals the minority carrier concentration at the same point in the dark when normalized to its value at the junction. This relationship is generalized, using a particularly simple yet elegant algorithm, both to single and multiple junction cells with arbitrary doping profiles and internal features such as voids, precipitates, dislocations, grain boundaries, and internal interfaces including those associated with polarity and bandgap changes. The relationship also has implications for simplified solar cell analysis, gaining insights into device operation and for the theory of limiting cell efficiencies and into the operation of devices with multiple independent junctions.},

Optically, reduced reflection and improved trapping of light within the cell have had a large impact. Features have increased silicon cell efficiency to a recently confirmed value of 24.7\%. Over recent years, good progress has been made in transferring some of the corresponding design improvements into commercial product with commercial cells of 17-18\% efficiency now commercially available, record values of a mere 15 years ago.

Not only does the latter result for this relatively low quality material closely approach the 20\% efficiency mark, once thought to be a limit on silicon cell performance regardless of multicrystalline material quality, but it also shows the potential for such multicrystalline material exceeding the performance capacity of standard crystalline Czochralski material.},

	volume = {90},
	issn = {0373-2266},
	abstract = {In 1999 and 2000, 45 Bar-tailed Godwits Limosa lapponica were supplied with radio-transmitters during spring staging on the island Texel in the western Wadden Sea. With the use of Automatic Radio Tracking Stations (ARTS) on Texel and in south Sweden, and hand-held receivers on Texel, it was possible to follow the later part of the stopover period on Texel for 34 birds (76\%) and the passage over south Sweden for 26 birds (58\%). Thus, the method of automatic tracking of overflying migrating shorebirds works successfully where the migration corridor is narrow and predictable, as in the case with late spring shorebird migration from the Wadden Sea towards arctic Russia. The timing of departure from Texel and passage over south Sweden of radio-marked birds, with median dates of 30 May and 2 June respectively, were in agreement with published data on the spring migration of Siberian-breeding Bar-tailed Godwits L. l. taymyrensis. The individual variation in migration dates was larger than expected, with birds passing south Sweden between 25 May and 10 June, indicating that the time-window for departure might be broader than previously thought. There was no clear difference between males and females in timing of migration. The time difference between departure from Texel and passage over south Sweden (average 3.3 days) indicates that most Bar-tailed Godwits do not embark on the long flight towards Siberia directly from the western Wadden Sea, but are more likely to stop in the more easterly portion of the Wadden Sea before the final take-off. This pattern is similar to what has been found in other shorebirds and geese (e.g. Red Knots Calidris canutus and Dark-bellied Brent Geese Branta bernicla) migrating along the same route.},

This arrangement of planes, each 1.25 square meters of area, allow an angular measurement for each track to 0.25 degrees in each of two projections. The steel absorber plate allows a measurement of the identity of each muon track to 96\% accuracy. Two data-taking triggers allow data to be simultaneously taken for a) extensive air showers (multiple coincidence station hits) at about 1 Hz and b) single muons (single tracks of identified muons) at 2000 Hz. Eight on-line computers pre-analyze the single track data and store the results on magnetic tape in compacted form with a minimum of computer dead-time. One additional computer reads data from the shower triggers and records this raw data on a separate magnetic tape with no pre-analysis.},

	abstract = {Selection and exploitation of feeding areas by pre-breeding and non-breeding Greylag Geese Anser anser, as well as by families, was studied in a breeding area consisting of four lakes in Scania, southernmost Sweden, in the years 1997-2000. Total production of young in each lake as well as the breeding performance of neck collared individuals was established annually, 1985-2000. This breeding population increased on average 15.3\% per annum, from 93 pairs in 1985 to 910 pairs in 2001. The two main field types used by pre-breeding pairs, males of incubating females and non-breeders in flocks were winter wheat and grassland, often switching from the former to the latter in mid-season. Almost all feeding during brood-rearing took place on pastures grazed by livestock or on a golf-course. Generally in spring, the rates of exploitation were below 300-400 goose days ha-1, but rates of {\textgreater}1,000 goose days ha-1 were noted for one cereal field and two grassland areas. The rates of exploitation by families varied markedly among brood-rearing areas as well as years, being highest all through the study period on a grazed pasture, where it ranged 800-1,350 goose days ha-1. IncLuding the utilisation by non-breeders, the annual exploitation of this pasture ranged from 1,400 to 2,500 goose days ha-1. At the only lake without grazing by livestock (since the mid-1990s), significantly fewer goslings survived to fledging than at the other lakes (45\% vs 70\%). Indications of density-dependent effects on the productivity of small young were noted at one of the lakes (Klosterviken) but not at another (Yddingen). Most likely, the lack of any density dependent effect, in spite of the very marked increase in the breeding population during the study period at Yddingen, is the result of access to highly fertilized grass on a golf course.},

	volume = {744},
	abstract = {A high power conversion efficiency above 1\% from a bulk crystalline silicon (c-Si) light-emitting diode (LED) has been demonstrated at near room temperature. These devices are based on normally weak one- and two-phonon assisted sub-bandgap light emission processes. Their improved performance results from device designs that take advantage of enhanced light absorption by a light trapping scheme which was developed for high efficiency silicon solar cells, and from reducing scope for parasitic non-radiative recombination within the diode. Each feature individually is shown to improve efficiency by a factor of ten, accounting for an improvement by factor of one hundred compared to baseline devices. Also demonstrated is a greatly improved band-edge light emission and detection using bulk c-Si diodes. A bulk c-Si LED is combined with a similar diode used as a detector that collects the light emitted with a high quantum collection efficiency of 33\%, to produce a silicon to silicon optically coupled system that demonstrates 0.18\% coupling quantum efficiency. The crystalline silicon LED demonstrates similarly high performance at very low power levels, where it has even higher power efficiency than a high efficiency GaAlAs LED.},

In this presentation, the author gives his views on the future of photovoltaics. He argues that current bulk wafer and ribbon approaches are too material intensive to allow the low costs required for photovoltaics to reach its full potential. A transition to thin-film technology is essential for this to occur. The reasons as to why this transition has been so difficult to achieve are then explored. The author identifies a certain "lack of robustness" of the candidate thin-films as the key reason for their failure. He provides evidence that this is not a universal thin-film feature, but demonstrates that modules even more robust than standard bulk silicon are possible, given an appropriate materials selection. It is then argued that a sensible strategy for companies feeling the pressure on prices being applied by the large manufacturers is not to try to compete on volume, but exploit the lower manufacturing costs per unit volume possible with more recent, rugged thin-films.},

	abstract = {One of the main disadvantages of thermophotovoltaics is the need for a highly perfect selective emitter or filter to achieve high conversion efficiency. Thermophotonics overcomes this through the use of a heated light emitting diode as an extremely selective emitter. To achieve net conversion of heat to electricity with thermophotonics, a LED with high external quantum efficiency is required. As the initial step to demonstrate this concept, an AlGaAs/GaAs double heterostructure was optically pumped with energy higher than bandgap at room temperature. An EQE of 80\% was measured for a doped planar sample on a transparent substrate. To the authors' knowledge this is the highest EQE for a planar structure ever reported. The results for undoped samples agree well with independent thermal measurements and with simulation data from our photon ray-tracing model. The low surface recombination velocity implies that the sample quality is excellent.},

Extraction of that power from a load as heat is feasible at the same limiting efficiencies as solar thermal converters.

A further loss was observed when these cells were illuminated under one-sun intensity using ELH halogen projection lamps. The lightly doped boron emitters and strong surface depletion might be the cause for such loss, which appear to have an electrostatic origin and to be largely reversible.},

This leads to the conclusion that efficiency will differentiate between viable and non-viable thin-film technologies in the longer term. Possible candidates for a "third generation" of high performance thin-film technology are discussed and work in progress towards implementing the more promising of these described.},

	abstract = {We prove that if X is any 2-regular projective scheme (in the sense of Castelnuovo-Mumford) then X is "small". This means that if L is a linear space and Y:= L{\textbackslash}cap X is finite, then Y is "linearly independent" in the sense that the dimension of the linear span of Y is 1+deg Y. The converse is true and well-known for finite schemes, but false in general. The main result of this paper is that the converse, "small implies 2-regular", is also true for reduced projective schemes (algebraic sets). This is proven by means of a delicate geometric analysis, leading to a complete classification: we show that the components of a small algebraic set are varieties of minimal degree, meeting in a particularly simple way. From the classification one can show that if X is 2-regular, then so is X\_red, and so also is the projection of X from any point of X. Our results extend the Del Pezzo-Bertini classification of varieties of minimal degree, the characterization of these as the varieties of regularity 2 by Eisenbud-Goto, and the construction of 2-regular square-free monomial ideals by Fröberg.},

	abstract = {Spring migration of arctic breeding birds, mainly waders and Dark-bellied Brent Geese Branta bernicla, was followed by tracking radar in Lund, South Sweden, during 1998-2001 in order to evaluate the capacity of these birds to exploit favourable winds. A total of 888 radar tracks were collected. Here I report on measured flight speeds, flight altitudes and winds and compare these with results from similar studies of arctic waders from around the world. Ground speeds were generally high, showing a strong support by following winds. The support by tailwinds was on average 8.3 m s-1. In total, 95\% of the tracked flocks were flying with supporting winds. Flight altitudes ranged between 100 m and 3745 m above ground with a grand mean of 1750 m. Birds flying at higher altitude experienced a stronger wind support than birds flying at lower altitude. Winds experienced by the birds differed from overall wind conditions during the seasons in question, the former showing a higher concentration in the most favourable sector (winds between south and west). The results indicate that these birds are selective in their choice of migration days with respect to wind, i.e. that they actively choose to migrate during days, and probably also at altitudes, giving them a good wind support. A relatively large proportion of the waders were also found to use strong tailwinds, exceeding the birds' own airspeeds, which support the suggestion of a risk-prone time-selected migration strategy in this group of birds.},

Materials-related education in these programs are mainly focussed on the photovoltaic aspects, including study of the fundamental optical, electronic, phononic and excitonic properties of silicon, crystal structure, semiconductor properties, doping and contacts. Cell manufacturing is taught in detail, including by the use of an interactive virtual production line. Practical projects, taking advantage of a large and active research group, are one of the most important and effective educational tools in both these programs, The Centre also administers postgraduate coursework and research programs. © 2006 Materials Research Society.},

	abstract = {Hot Carrier solar cells have long been recognized as an attractive contender in the search for high efficiency photovoltaic devices but their fabrication requires solution of two important material challenges: finding materials with drastically reduced carrier cooling rates and realization of selective energy contacts to extract the photogenerated carriers. This paper is concerned with the problem of absorber phononic engineering to reduce carrier cooling rates. The physics of carrier cooling is explored and experimental data of other authors are discussed with a view to assessing the potential of state-of-the art nanostructured materials for PV conversion. A tentative initial calculation based on the thermalisation in these nanostructures and assuming all other aspects as ideal, gives 54\% efficiency at 2500suns as compared to 54\% for no thermalisation at all. Phononic band gap engineering to further reduce carrier cooling or bring down the threshold concentration is discussed.},

	abstract = {An up-converter (UC) absorbs two or more low-energy photons and emits a single high-energy photon. A down-converter (DC) absorbs a single high-energy photon and emits two or more low energy photons. The current work extends previous limiting efficiency analysis to a combination of UC and DC; an up converter with two levels; and to compare analyses using real air mass data with that modelling the sun as a blackbody. Analysis has been carried out both with the band gap of the cell as an optimized parameter and at a fixed value of 1 .leV. All of UC, DC and two level UC are shown to improve efficiencies for both spectra. Combined UC/DC improves the efficiency further for the 1.1 eV band gap but gives a lower efficiency for the optimised band gap. The explanation for this unexpected result is presented based on the small coupling losses that result from absorption/re-emission in the DC. The limiting efficiencies of such an approach are very similar to several other third generation concepts such as impurity PV, Intermediate Band solar cells or three level tandems. However in practice the UC (or DC) approach has the advantage that the optical properties of the UC are decoupled from the electrical properties of the PV cell, and hence each can be optimised independently. This means that it may be the simplest third generation approach to implement using existing PV cells, if a reasonable UC efficiency can be obtained. Nonetheless experimental work on realising UC is at an early stage. Some of the work on rare earth doped UC is reviewed together with the potential to improve the spectral sensitivity to below band gap radiation. © 2008 Materials Research Society.},

	title = {Eisenstein series for higher-rank groups and string theory amplitudes},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0163v4},
	abstract = {Scattering amplitudes of superstring theory are strongly constrained by the requirement that they be invariant under dualities generated by discrete subgroups, E\_n(Z), of simply-laced Lie groups in the E\_n series (n{\textless}= 8). In particular, expanding the four-supergraviton amplitude at low energy gives a series of higher derivative corrections to Einstein's theory, with coefficients that are automorphic functions with a rich dependence on the moduli. Boundary conditions supplied by string and supergravity perturbation theory, together with a chain of relations between successive groups in the E\_n series, constrain the constant terms of these coefficients in three distinct parabolic subgroups. Using this information we are able to determine the expressions for the first two higher derivative interactions (which are BPS-protected) in terms of specific Eisenstein series. Further, we determine key features of the coefficient of the third term in the low energy expansion of the four-supergraviton amplitude (which is also BPS-protected) in the E\_8 case. This is an automorphic function that satisfies an inhomogeneous Laplace equation and has constant terms in certain parabolic subgroups that contain information about all the preceding terms.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a novel in situ polymerization technique to develop localized polymer coatings on the surface of dispersed pristine graphene sheets. Graphene sheets show great promise as strong, conductive fillers in polymer nanocomposites; however, difficulties in dispersion quality and interfacial strength between filler and matrix have been a persistent problem for graphene-based nanocomposites, particularly for pristine graphene. To address this problem, a physisorbed polymer layer is used to stabilize graphene sheets in solution. To form this protective layer, an organic microenvironment is formed around dispersed graphene sheets in surfactant solutions, and a nylon 6,10 or nylon 6,6 coating is created via interfacial polymerization. A similar technique was originally developed to protect luminescent properties of carbon nanotubes in solution. These coated graphene dispersions are aggregation-resistant and may be reversibly redispersed in water even after freeze-drying. The coated graphene holds promise for a number of applications, including multifunctional graphene-polymer nanocomposites.},

These polymer-stabilized graphene dispersions are shown to be highly stable and readily redispersible even after freeze-drying. This technique yields significantly higher graphene concentrations as compared to prior studies. Excellent enhancement in thermal conductivity of the fluid by addition of pristine graphene is also demonstrated. These well-dispersed pristine graphene sheets were then used as a strong and conductive nano-filler for polymer nanocomposites. PVP/graphene nanocomposites were produced via bulk polymerization of N-vinylpyrrolidone loaded with dispersed graphene, resulting in excellent load transfer and improved mechanical and electrical properties.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4154v2},
	abstract = {Neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments can potentially determine the Majorana or Dirac nature of the neutrino, and aid in understanding the neutrino absolute mass scale and hierarchy. Future 76Ge-based searches target a half-life sensitivity of {\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}27 y to explore the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. Reaching this sensitivity will require a background rate of {\textless}1 count tonne{\textasciicircum}-1 y{\textasciicircum}-1 in a 4-keV-wide spectral region of interest surrounding the Q value of the decay. We investigate the overburden required to reach this background goal in a tonne-scale experiment with a compact (copper and lead) shield based on Monte Carlo calculations of cosmic-ray background rates. We find that, in light of the presently large uncertainties in these types of calculations, a site with an underground depth {\textgreater} 5200 mwe is required for a tonne-scale experiment with a compact shield similar to the planned 40-kg MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR. The required overburden is highly dependent on the chosen shielding configuration and could be relaxed significantly if, for example, a liquid cryogen and water shield, or an active neutron shield were employed. Operation of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR and GERDA detectors will serve to reduce the uncertainties on cosmic-ray background rates and will impact the choice of shielding style and location for a future tonne-scale experiment. 4/2013: The peer review process revealed that one of the veto rejection factors (the factor-of-4 described on p12) needs to be better established. Our reevaluation of this parameter to date has not yielded strong support for the value stated in the manuscript, and we require further study to develop a solid estimate. This further study will supersede the work described in this manuscript, and may or may not lead to the same conclusion regarding the {\textgreater}5200 mwe requirement for future tonne-scale 76Ge neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.},

	abstract = {We report on the status of theBaltic/Wadden Sea flyway Eider population based on trends in breeding and wintering numbers throughout the region, supplemented by changes in the sex ratio and proportion of young Eiders as monitored in the Danish hunting bag. At the flyway scale, total numbers of breeding pairs decreased by 48\% during 2000-2009, after relatively stable breeding numbers in 1991-2000. The majority of the population nest in Finland and Sweden,where the number of breeding pairs has halved over the same period. After initial declines in winter numbers between 1991 and 2000, during 2000- 2009, national wintering numbers increased in the Baltic Sea, but decreased in the Wadden Sea. The annual proportion of adult females in the Danish hunting bag data de- creased from ca.45\%(1982) to ca.25\%(2009) and simultaneously the proportion of firstwinter birds fell from ca. 70\% to ca. 30\%, indicating dramatic structural changes in the Danish wintering numbers. These results suggest that the total flyway populationwill experience further declines, unless productivity increases and the factors responsible for decreasing adult female survival are identified and ameliorated.We discuss potential population drivers and present some recommendations for improved flyway-level monitoring and management of Eiders.},

The transition region between the active germanium and the fully dead layer of the n+ contact is examined. Energy depositions in this transition region are shown to result in partial charge collection. This provides a mechanism for events with a well defined energy to contribute to the continuum of the energy spectrum at lower energies. A novel technique to quantify the contribution from this source of background is introduced. Experiments that operate germanium detectors with a very low energy threshold may benefit from the methods presented herein.},

	abstract = {Light trapping is essential for Si thin-film solar cells on glass, and is generally realized by texturing the glass substrate. Aluminium induced textured (AIT) glass is one such method. To reproduce this texture by a cheap and fast way such as nano-imprinting, the best light trapping structure is required for the master template. Therefore, AIT glass needs to be optimised by varying the processing parameters: as-deposited Al thickness, Al deposition rate, and chemical etch composition. The conventional AIT etch, etching for 20 s in mixture of 49\%HF+69\%HNO3, requires considerable experience to control the etch rate and therefore the final AIT structure, making it difficult to scale up for commercialization. In this work, this etch is replaced by an alternative etch comprising NaOH and a HF dip (4·9\% HF solution). Textures prepared by the new etch demonstrate matched absorption and EQE as those prepared by the conventional etch.},

	abstract = {The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR will search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of the 76Ge isotope with a mixed array of enriched and natural germanium detectors. The observation of this rare decay would indicate the neutrino is its own anti-particle, demonstrate that lepton number is not conserved, and provide information on the absolute mass-scale of the neutrino. The DEMONSTRATOR is being assembled at the 4850 foot level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. The array will be contained in a low-background environment and surrounded by passive and active shielding. The goals for the DEMONSTRATOR are: demonstrating a background rate less than 3 t\${\textasciicircum}-1\$ y\${\textasciicircum}-1\$ in the 4 keV region of interest (ROI) surrounding the 2039 keV 76Ge endpoint energy; establishing the technology required to build a tonne-scale germanium based double-beta decay experiment; testing the recent claim of observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay [H.

	abstract = {Invariance of Type IIB superstring theory under SL(2,Z) or S-duality implies dependence on the complex coupling T through real and complex modular forms in T. Their structure may be understood explicitly in an expansion of superstring corrections to Einstein's equations of gravity, in powers of derivatives D and curvature R. The perturbative loop expansion in the string coupling for the 4-string amplitude governs corrections of the form D{\textasciicircum}2p R{\textasciicircum}4 for all p. We show that, at two-loop order, the D{\textasciicircum}6 R{\textasciicircum}4 term is proportional to the integral of a modular invariant introduced by Zhang and Kawazumi in number theory and related to the Faltings delta-invariant studied for genus-two by Bost. The structure of two-loop superstring amplitudes for p{\textgreater}3 leads to higher invariants, which generalize Zhang–Kawazumi invariants at genus two. An explicit formula is derived for the unique higher invariant associated with order D{\textasciicircum}8 R{\textasciicircum}4. In an attempt to compare the prediction for the D{\textasciicircum}6 R{\textasciicircum}4 correction from superstring perturbation theory with the one produced by S-duality and supersymmetry of Type IIB, various reformulations of the invariant are given. This comparison with string theory leads to a predicted value for the integral of the Zhang-Kawazumi invariant over the moduli space of genus-two surfaces.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1373v1},
	abstract = {Standard models of ion channel voltage gating require substantial movement of one transmembrane segment, S4, of the voltage sensing domain. Evidence comes from the accessibility to external methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents of the positively charged arginine residues (R) on this segment. These are first mutated to cysteines (C), which in turn react with MTS reagents; it is assumed that the C is passively carried in the S4 movement, becoming accessible on one side or the other of the membrane. However, the Rs were salt bridged to negatively charged residues on other transmembrane segments, or hydrogen bonded, while C reacts as a negative ion. The space available for MTS is fairly close to the difference in volume between the large R residue and much smaller C, so the MTS is not severely sterically hindered. A reagent molecule can reach a C side chain; the C can react if not repelled by a negative charge from the amino acid to which the R had been salt bridged. Nearby protons may also make reaction possible unless the C itself is protonated. Therefore interpretation of the C substitution results requires reconsideration. To test the idea we have done quantum calculations on part of a mutated S4 and the nearby section of the channel. The mutation is R300C of the 2A79/3Lut structure, a mutation that would be done to test MTS reagent access; there is a large cavity where the R is replaced by C. Two quantum calculations show a substantial difference in the structure of this cavity with 2 water molecules compared to 4. This suggests that the structure, and presumably reaction probability, could depend on water molecules, very likely also protons, in or near the cavity that the R300C mutation produces.},

	abstract = {Current models of antineutrino production in nuclear reactors predict detection rates and spectra at odds with the existing body of direct reactor antineutrino measurements. High-resolution antineutrino detectors operated close to compact research reactor cores can produce new precision measurements useful in testing explanations for these observed discrepancies involving underlying nuclear or new physics. Absolute measurement of the 235U-produced antineutrino spectrum can provide additional constraints for evaluating the accuracy of current and future reactor models, while relative measurements of spectral distortion between differing baselines can be used to search for oscillations arising from the existence of eV-scale sterile neutrinos. Such a measurement can be performed in the United States at several highly-enriched uranium fueled research reactors using near-surface segmented liquid scintillator detectors. We describe here the conceptual design and physics potential of the PROSPECT experiment, a U.S.-based, multi-phase experiment with reactor-detector baselines of 7-20 meters capable of addressing these and other physics and detector development goals. Current R\&D status and future plans for PROSPECT detector deployment and data-taking at the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory will be discussed.},

	abstract = {© 2014 American Chemical Society. The past two years have seen the uniquely rapid emergence of a new class of solar-cell-based on mixed organic-inorganic halide perovskite. In this work, we demonstrate a promising technique for studying the morphology of perovskite and its impact on carrier extraction by carrier transport layer using one-photon and two-photon fluorescence imaging in conjunction with time-resolved photoluminescence. This technique is not only effective in separating surface and bulk effects but it also allows the determination of lifetimes in localized regions and local carrier extraction efficiency. The difference in sensitivities of transport materials to grain boundaries and film uniformity is highlighted in this study. It is shown that the PCBM fabricated in this work is more sensitive to film nonuniformity, whereas spiro-OMeTAD is more sensitive to grain boundaries in terms of effective carrier extraction.

In this paper we determine the exact \$SL(2,{\textbackslash}mathbb Z)\$-invariant solution \$f(x+iy)\$ to this differential equation satisfying an appropriate moderate growth condition as \$y{\textbackslash}to ınfty\$ (the weak coupling limit). The solution is presented as a Fourier series with modes \${\textbackslash}widehatf\_n(y) e{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}pi i n x\$, where the mode coefficients, \${\textbackslash}widehatf\_n(y)\$ are bilinear in \$K\$-Bessel functions.

Within 10 years, the group had established an international reputation, achieving its first world record in the form of a silicon solar cell with independently confirmed 18\% efficiency in 1983. This was a significant improvement upon efficiency levels initially established at Bell Laboratories and then further enhanced by the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT, a company established specifically to develop US space communications technology). This record was the first of 18 successive internationally certified UNSW increments that took efficiency first beyond the 20\% level, regarded us the "four-minute mile" of the field, eventually to 25\%. The PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) technology used to achieve the 25\% result is now finding its way into commercial production as manufacturers follow the trail to higher efficiency earlier blazed in the laboratory. The PERC cell is expected to become the commercially dominant technology within the next 5 years as manufacturers inch towards 25\% cell conversion efficiency in production.},

Both simulation and experimental works have been performed looking at a silicon solar cell under a truncated spectrum below 1.5 eV filtered by the upper layers in the multijunction stack. Good agreement is seen between the modeling and experimental results, identifying different emitter design requirements when the solar cell operates under a full or truncated spectrum. A well-passivated front surface, i.e., with low-interface surface recombination velocity, required a lightly doped emitter profile to maximize open-circuit voltage ( V OC ), while a high-interface recombination surface requires a heavily doped for higher V OC values. The impact on short-circuit current density ( J SC ) is found to be minimal, even with large variations in the interface recombination and emitter profiles. In a tandem stack, an interface with low- and high-interface recombination velocities would require lightly doped and intermediate-doped emitters, respectively, for maximum conversion efficiency (η).},

The first set of efficiency limits is calculated based on the detailed balance principle, assuming a stepwise absorption profile. Practical limits are then calculated using Si absorption data and Auger recombination parameters from the literature. The Si wafer thickness is also considered in the two-stack tandem design. Performances of the tandems are compared when various Si solar cell technologies are used as the bottom subcells. The impact of external radiative efficiency and external quantum efficiency of the top subcell on the tandem performance is studied. Efficiency limits using state-of-the-art devices, and the effect of varying cell thickness on tandem efficiencies is also reported.},

	abstract = {TOGAF is a framework - a detailed method and a set of supporting tools - for developing an enterprise architecture, developed by members of The Open Group Architecture Forum. TOGAF Version 9.1 is a maintenance update to TOGAF 9, addressing comments raised since the introduction of TOGAF 9 in 2009. It retains the major features and structure of TOGAF 9, thereby preserving existing investment in TOGAF, and adds further detail and clarification to what is already proven.It may be used freely by any organization wishing to develop an enterprise architecture for use within that organization (subject to the Conditions of Use). This Book is divided into seven parts: Part I - Introduction This part provides a high-level introduction to the key concepts of enterprise architecture and in particular the TOGAF approach. It contains the definitions of terms used throughout TOGAF and release notes detailing the changes between this version and the previous version of TOGAF. Part II - Architecture Development Method This is the core of TOGAF. It describes the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) – a step-by-step approach to developing an enterprise architecture. Part III - ADM Guidelines \& Techniques This part contains a collection of guidelines and techniques available for use in applying TOGAF and the TOGAF ADM. Part IV - Architecture Content Framework This part describes the TOGAF content framework, including a structured metamodel for architectural artifacts, the use of re-usable architecture building blocks, and an overview of typical architecture deliverables. Part V - Enterprise Continuum \& Tools This part discusses appropriate taxonomies and tools to categorize and store the outputs of architecture activity within an enterprise. Part VI - TOGAF Reference Models This part provides a selection of architectural reference models, which includes the TOGAF Foundation Architecture, and the Integrated Information Infrastructure Reference Model (III-RM). Part VII Architecture Capability Framework This section looks at roles, Governance, compliance skills and much more practical guidance},
